# READ THIS FIRST

Noble time travellers from the future, welcome back to the 1980s! We've prepared a special assignment for you to complete, so put your Rubik's Cube aside, turn the Walkman off, and get to work!

We know you're in a hurry, so here are some hints to get you started:

- You can find a GUI client that allows you to interact with this service at https://github.com/bildschirmtext/btx_decoder, more precisely, in the `sdl` subfolder. Unfortunately, like many contemporary computers, the vulnbox does not have GUI capabilities -- but we've heard your IBM PCâ€“compatible microcomputers from the future are well-equipped to run this kind of software.

- You will need the SDL2 library (Debian: `libsdl2-dev`) to compile and run the client. If you run into compilation issues, you may want to try the patch `btx_decoder.patch`. We're sure you'll figure this out.

- When the client asks you to press `*`, press `F1`. For `#` press `F2`.

The Saarsec thanks all contributors of the [Bildschirmtext project on GitHub](https://github.com/bildschirmtext) for keeping BTX alive. Their work made this service possible. We have slimmed down, adapted and built upon their code. All (intentional) vulnerabilities were added by The Saarsec.
